## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine (v14 or above recommended)  
- **Visual Studio Code** recommended, but any code editor can be used

## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Check if Node.js is installed**  
   Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   - If you see a version number (e.g., v22.18.0), Node.js is installed.
   - If not, install Node.js first.
2. **Install Node.js (if needed)**
   - Download and install Node.js from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Confirm installation by running **node -v** again.
3. **Open the project in VS Code**
   - Navigate to your project folder and open it in VS Code.
   - Open a terminal inside VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
4. **Run an exercise**
   - In the terminal, run a specific JavaScript file with Node.js:
     ```bash
     node exercise_01.js
     ```
   - Replace the path with file you want to run (e.g., **exercise_02.js**).
5. View the output
